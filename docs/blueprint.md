# **App Name**: Chromatic Recall

## Core Features:

- Maze Visualization: Display a grid of colored cubes in a 3D perspective.
- Path Illumination: Temporarily illuminate a path of colored cubes, then dim them after a short observation period.
- User Navigation: Allow the player to navigate the maze using swipe (mobile) or WASD keys (PC).
- Sequence Validation: Validate player movement against the original color sequence; reset if the sequence is broken.
- Completion Feedback: Visually indicate progress and completion by highlighting the path upon successful completion.
- Procedural Level Generation: Utilize a generative AI tool to create varied level layouts with distinct color sequences and path difficulties. Parameters include maze complexity, color palette similarity, and path length.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric Indigo (#6F00FF), symbolizing memory and spatial reasoning.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#2F4F4F), a desaturated hue in alignment with the primary color, ensuring that interactive elements take center stage.
- Accent color: Luminous Vivid Violet (#A020F0) provides contrast and attracts focus.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font that conveys a sense of modernism, fitting the game's blend of memory challenge and digital navigation. Well suited for titles, labels, and short text.
- Use minimalist icons to represent hints, scores, and settings. Each icon should be designed in a geometric style with clean lines, resonating with the cube-based maze environment.
- The game interface is divided into three sections: the upper section houses the 3D maze, the middle section contains controls and interactive buttons, and the bottom section displays scores, hints, and game settings.
- Implement subtle animations when illuminating the path, selecting cubes, and transitioning between game states to enhance user feedback without causing distraction.
